## Project Nexus Documentation
A documentation hub for my major learnings from the **ProDev Backend Engineering** program.  
This repository highlights backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices gained throughout the journey.
## Overview of the Program
The ProDev Backend Engineering program is designed to equip learners with the skills to build, deploy, and scale robust backend systems.  
It covers a wide range of technologies, software engineering principles, and collaborative practices used in real-world development.

# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to: 
- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.
- Serve as a reference guide for both current and future learners.
- Foster collaboration between frontend and backend learners.

# Implementation Plan
## 1. Project Initialization 
<pre><code> django-admin startproject ecommerce_backend
 cd ecommerce_backend
 python manage.py startapp products
 python manage.py startapp users
</code></pre>

## 2. Database Design (PostgreSQL)
Entities:
- User
- Category
- Product
### Database Schema:
<pre><code>User
- id (UUID, PK)
- username (unique)
- email (unique)
- password (hashed)
 
Category
- id (UUID, PK)
- name
- slug
Product
- id (UUID, PK)
- name
- description
- price (Decimal)
- category (FK to Category)
- created_at
- updated_at </code></pre>
## Optimizations:
- Indexes on Product.price, Product.category_id
- Full-text search index on Product.name (optional)
- Slug field indexed for category
## 3. User Authentication with JWT
Use `djangorestframework-simplejwt` for secure token-based authentication.

Endpoints:

`POST /api/token/` – Login

`POST /api/token/refresh/` – Token refresh

`POST /api/register/` – User registration

### Security Considerations:
- Password hashing (Django handles this)
- JWT expiration and refresh
- Throttling login attempts (via DRF)
## 4. CRUD APIs for Products and Categories
Using `Django REST Framework with ModelViewSet` for DRY CRUD operations.

Endpoints:

- Product

  - `GET /api/products/`

  - `GET /api/products/<id>/`

  - `POST /api/products/`

  - `PUT/PATCH /api/products/<id>/`

  - `DELETE /api/products/<id>/`

- Category

  - `GET /api/categories/`

  - `POST /api/categories/`
## 5. Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination

Use `DjangoFilterBackend and DRF’s` built-in pagination.

- Filters:

  - Filter by category

  - Search by name

  - Sort by price, created_at

- Sample Query:
<pre><code>GET /api/products/?category=electronics&ordering=-price&search=laptop</code></pre>
## 6. Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

Use `drf-yasg` to auto-generate Swagger docs.

- Features:

  - Interactive API testing

  - Secure endpoints with JWT

  - Tags and descriptions for each endpoint
- Endpoint:

  - `/swagger/`
 ## 7. Performance Optimizations

- Add indexes to price, category, and created_at fields

- Use select_related() for related lookups (e.g., category in product)

- Optimize large queries with pagination

- Use read-only serializers where applicable
## 8. Final Touches

- CORS config for frontend access

- Setup .env for secrets

- Dockerfile + docker-compose (optional)

- Unit and integration tests

### Documentation:

- Add a `README.md` with setup and API usage

- Host Swagger docs or export to Postman
#Deployment

Use `Heroku` to:

- Deploy the Django API

- Publish the Swagger docs endpoint

- Host PostgreSQL (or connect to external DB)
# Key Technologies Covered
- **Python** – Core programming language for backend logic
- **Django** – High-level web framework for rapid development
- **REST APIs** – Standardized approach for building scalable APIs
- **GraphQL** – Flexible query language for APIs
- **Docker** – Containerization for consistent deployments
- **CI/CD** – Automation pipelines for testing and deployment

# Key Features

- Comprehensive Documentation: Covers backend engineering concepts such as RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, Message Queues, CI/CD Pipelines, Celery & RabbitMQ, and System Design.

- Challenges & Solutions: Includes real-world challenges faced and implemented solutions.
- Best Practices & Takeaways: Highlights industry best practices and personal insights.
- Collaboration Hub: Encourages teamwork between frontend and backend learners.

# Important Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design** – Modeling relational data effectively  
- **Asynchronous Programming** – Enhancing performance with concurrency  
- **Caching Strategies** – Improving speed and reducing load with Redis/Memcached

# Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Debugging complex API integrations  
  **Solution:** Used Postman and Django’s DRF testing utilities to isolate issues  

- **Challenge:** Managing environment differences (local vs production)  
  **Solution:** Implemented `.env` files and Docker for consistency  

- **Challenge:** CI/CD pipeline failures  
  **Solution:** Broke down steps into smaller jobs, used GitHub Actions logs to debug
# Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
- Write **clean, maintainable code** following PEP8 standards  
- Use **version control** effectively (branching, pull requests, code reviews)  
- Prioritize **testing and automation** early in development  
- Collaborating with peers significantly enhances learning  
- Always document code, APIs, and processes for clarity

# Collaboration - Key for Success
Collaborate with Whom?
Fellow ProDev Frontend Learners: 
- Exchange ideas, develop synergies, organize study/coding sessions. Maximize your potential and that of your colleagues!
ProDev Backend Learners:
- Collaboration with backend learners is essential, as you will use their endpoints to complete your project.

# Next Steps
- Continue refining backend projects with advanced features (e.g., microservices, event-driven systems).  
- Explore cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  
- Mentor and collaborate with future learners.
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
