# E-Commerce Backend for project-nexus
## Real-World Application

The e-commerce backend simulates a real-world development environment, emphasizing scalability, security, and performance. Participants will: - Design and optimize relational database schemas. - Build and document APIs for frontend integration. - Enhance backend performance through query optimization and indexing.

# Overview of the project
This project focuses on developing a robust backend system to support an e-commerce product catalog. The backend will handle product data management, user authentication, and APIs for filtering, sorting, and pagination, simulating a real-world scenario for backend engineers. It covers a wide range of technologies, software engineering principles, and collaborative practices used in real-world development.

# Project Goals

- CRUD APIs: Build APIs for managing products, categories, and user authentication.
- Filtering, Sorting, Pagination: Implement robust logic for efficient product discovery.
- Database Optimization: Design a high-performance database schema to support seamless queries.

# Core Functionalities
The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.
## 1. User Management
- User Registration:
  - Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
  - Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- User Login and Authentication:
  - Implement login via email and password.
  - Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
-  Profile Management:
  - Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.
## 2. Property Listings Management
- Add Listings:
  - Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
- Edit/Delete Listings:
  -Hosts can update or remove their property listings.
## 3. Search and Filtering
- Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:
  - Location
  - Price range
  - Number of guests
  - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
## 4. Booking Management
- Booking Creation:
  - Guests can book a property for specified dates.
  - Prevent double bookings using date validation.
- Booking Cancellation:
  - Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
- Booking Status:
  - Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.
## 5. Payment Integration
- Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
  - Upfront payments by guests.
  - Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
  - Include support for multiple currencies.
## 6. Reviews and Ratings
- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Hosts can respond to reviews.
- Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.
## 7. Notifications System
- Implement email and in-app notifications for:
  - Booking confirmations
  - Cancellations
  - Payment updates
## 8. Admin Dashboard
- Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
  - Users
  - Listings
  - Bookings
  - Payments
# Technical Requirements
## 1. Database Management
- Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL.
- Required tables:
  - Users
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Reviews
  - Payments
## 2. API Development
- Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
- Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
- GET (retrieve data)
- POST (create data)
- PUT/PATCH (update data)
- DELETE (remove data)
## 3. Authentication and Authorization
- Use JWT for secure user sessions.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
- Guests
- Hosts
- Admins
## 4. File Storage (Scenario based)
- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage
## 5. Third-Party Services
- Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.
## 6. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement global error handling for APIs.
# Non-Functional Requirements
## 1. Scalability
- Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
- Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.
## 2. Security
- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
- Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.
## 3. Performance Optimization
Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
Optimize database queries to reduce server load.
## 4. Testing
- Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
- Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
## Optimizations:
- Indexes on Product.price, Product.category_id
- Full-text search index on Product.name (optional)
- Slug field indexed for category
## 3. User Authentication with JWT
Use `djangorestframework-simplejwt` for secure token-based authentication.

Endpoints:

`POST /api/token/` – Login

`POST /api/token/refresh/` – Token refresh

`POST /api/register/` – User registration

### Security Considerations:
- Password hashing (Django handles this)
- JWT expiration and refresh
- Throttling login attempts (via DRF)
## 4. CRUD APIs for Products and Categories
Using `Django REST Framework with ModelViewSet` for DRY CRUD operations.

Endpoints:

- Product

  - `GET /api/products/`

  - `GET /api/products/<id>/`

  - `POST /api/products/`

  - `PUT/PATCH /api/products/<id>/`

  - `DELETE /api/products/<id>/`

- Category

  - `GET /api/categories/`

  - `POST /api/categories/`
## 5. Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination

Use `DjangoFilterBackend and DRF’s` built-in pagination.

- Filters:

  - Filter by category

  - Search by name

  - Sort by price, created_at

- Sample Query:
<pre><code>GET /api/products/?category=electronics&ordering=-price&search=laptop</code></pre>
## 6. Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

Use `drf-yasg` to auto-generate Swagger docs.

- Features:

  - Interactive API testing

  - Secure endpoints with JWT

  - Tags and descriptions for each endpoint
- Endpoint:

  - `/swagger/`
 ## 7. Performance Optimizations

- Add indexes to price, category, and created_at fields

- Use select_related() for related lookups (e.g., category in product)

- Optimize large queries with pagination

- Use read-only serializers where applicable
## 8. Final Touches

- CORS config for frontend access

- Setup .env for secrets

- Dockerfile + docker-compose (optional)

- Unit and integration tests

### Documentation:

- Add a `README.md` with setup and API usage

- Host Swagger docs or export to Postman
#Deployment

Use `Heroku` to:

- Deploy the Django API

- Publish the Swagger docs endpoint

- Host PostgreSQL (or connect to external DB)
